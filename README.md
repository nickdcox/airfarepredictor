### 1. Business Understanding

The objectives of this project are to:
1. Build a multiple regression model to predict the price of US domestic airfares using a base set of numeric and categorical features (origin, destination, airline, class, month of travel and number of stops on route).
2. Add additional features to the data-set to determine if each individually has a positive or negative effect on the effectiveness of the model to predict airfares, e.g., weather, monthly demand, monthly oil price, politics and happiness.


### 2. Data Mining

#### AirFare Data:
The primary source of data for this project is the Airline Origin and Destination Survey (DB1B) database made available by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) at https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DatabaseInfo.asp?DB_ID=125.  The Airline Origin and Destination Survey is a 10% sample of airline tickets from reporting carriers collected by the Office of Airline Information of the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Data includes origin, destination and other itinerary details of passengers transported. This database is used to determine air traffic patterns, air carrier market shares and passenger flows.

The database has three tables: DB1BCoupon, DB1BMarket and DB1BTicket.  The first contains coupon-specific information for each domestic itinerary, the second contains directional market characteristics of each domestic itinerary and the last contains summary characteristics of each domestic itinerary.  The first two tables were used for the purposes of this project.  We downloaded data for the period January 1 to December 31, 2019.

For the purposes of this project a flight is defined as a journey from an origin airport to a destination airport with zero or more stops in between.

**DB1BCoupon:** 
* ITIN_ID - To join with the DB1BMarket table.
* FARE_CLASS - The class of travel for the flight: Coach (X, Y), Business (C, D) First (F, G).  This field is not available in the DB1BMarket table.

**DB1BMarket:** 
* ITIN_ID - To join with the DB1BCoupon table.
* YEAR - Year the flight took place.  This field was not used.
* QUARTER - Quarter the flight took place.
* ORIGIN_AIRPORT_ID	ORIGIN - ID for the origin airport of the flight.
* ORIGIN - Three letter code for the origin airport of the flight.
* DEST_AIRPORT_ID	DEST - ID for the destination airport of the flight.
* DEST - Three letter code for the destination airport of the flight.
* AIRPORT_GROUP - List of airports that the flight operated through, including origin and destination.
* TICKET_CARRIER - Airline operating the flight.
* BULK_FARE - An indicator to signify whether the flight was purchased in bulk.
* PASSENGERS - Number of passengers booked together on the flight.
* MARKET_FARE - Actual fare for the flight.  This is the target value that we will be trying to predict.
* MARKET_MILES_FLOWN - Actual miles flown.
* NONSTOP_MILES - Nonstop mies directly from origin to destination.


#### Other Data:
The remaining data was obtained from a variety of sources, as listed below.

**Historical Crude Oil Prices (2011 â€“ 2019):** An average of oil prices was calculated for each month of the year based on data from 2011 to 2019.\

**Monthly Domestic Scheduled Enplanements on U.S. Airlines 2018:** The total number of domestic enplanements was collected for each month of 2018, the most recent year for which such data is available.\

### 3. Data Cleaning

The first step in cleaning the data was to concatenate the quaterly datasets into a single dataset for both DB1BCoupon and DB1BMarket and then to merge the resulting two datasets into one.

The following cleaning steps were then undertaken to avoid the model being skewed:
* Flights for all airlines (TICKET_CARRIER) other than the top 11 domestic airlines were dropped from the dataset (Top 11: AA, AS, B6, DL, F9, G4, HA, NK, SY, UA, WN)
* Flights without a FARE_CLASS recorded were dropped.
* Flights that were booked as part of a bulk reservation were dropped.
* Flights that were booked for more than 1 passenger were dropped.
* Fields not required for model training were dropped (ITIN_ID, YEAR, ORIGIN, DEST, BULK_FARE, PASSENGERS, NONSTOP_MILES)

This resulted in approximately 72 million flight records.  We then used a Python function to select a random sample of 10 million flight records for model training and validation.
